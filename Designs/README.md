### Design

Before start coding, I should create a nice and neat design to work with later, so that's what I'm going to do in this directory! :D.

### TechStack

I've seen lot of designs programs and one of the best looks like it is Sketch, but you must pay to use it, so I'll use Inkscape! A great free an open-source vector graphics editor!.

Moreover, I'll take some notes in this file to remind myself how to do certain things :).

### Inkscape Mini Tutorial:

##### 1. Set the canvas size

To set the size, go to *File* -> *Document Properties* and define the canva's height and width. Also, in the dialogue box shown in the picture below, change the measurement unit to pixels. For a start, you can set the size to **1200x720px** (probably you will have to increase the height due to scrollbars) for the desktop version of the website. Keep in mind that different devices require a different version of the design!

##### 2. Draw the grid

The most common grid for desktop devices is **12 column 960px wide grid**. However, designers and developers nowadays choose various grids. To create a custom grid, divide the desired width by 12. Take into consideration some pixels for the gutter between clolumns, as well - let's say 20px between each column. Start drawing the guidelines according to the size of the canvas and the grid width. To draw the guidelines, click the rulers surrounding the workspace. Hold and drag the guideline to the canvas. Ruler on the left provides vertical guidelines, while top ruler provides horizontal ones. Create as many guidelines as you need. To specify theis position double click on each guideline and place it according to your calculations. 

To do it faster:
`Extensions` -> `Render` -> `Grid`


#### 3. Lock the guides

To avoid misplaceing, click on the **lock icon** situated in the top left corner beside the rulers and lock the guidelines.

#### Inkscape tools

* **Select tool**: is used to choose the objects in your document and change their size, rotate them, flip them and manipulate in different ways. To select multiple objects click on the objects while holding the Shift key.
* **Rectangle and Ellipse Tools**: the tools for drawing basic geometric shapes as squares and ellipses are the ones you will most definitely use a lot. Whether it is for creating buttons, menus or any other container that might appear in your design.
* **Polygon Tool**: if you need more complex shapes, like triangles, stars, hexagons and various polygons, you should reach for this tool. 
* **Fill and Stroke**: even though it is a very basic option, fills and strokes help you create design wonders.  It has options like gradient, blur, stroke styile and opacity. To open it `Object`->`Fill and Stroke`.
* **Text tool**: quite obvious, isn't it?
* **Zoom tool**: same than the previous one.
* **Duplicate, Copy and Paste**: `Ctrl-D`-> copy+paste, `Ctrl-C`->copy, `Ctrl-D`->paste.

#### Align and Distribute

It allows you to **align elements quickly**, relative to a specific feauture. As follows, you can align them relative to the page, relative to the order of selecting or to the bigger and smaller object. What is more, this tool will help you set the equal distances between multiples objects. To use this tool and make your designs as neat as a pin, go to `Object`->`Align and Distribute`.
