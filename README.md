# Manga

This is a personal project without a deadline. I dont know a lot about web design, React, NodeJS, etc, so the main aim of this is to learn and ""master"" some of these technologies while I build an entire manga web page.

### What can you find here:

In this repository I'm going to upload all the code I type as well as all the tech information I need to make this web page true. And one day, in the close future, I strongly wish that you find here an easy, free and open-source way to make your own manga web page :).

### Milestones:

This section will hold little milestones that I will have to complete... some day...maybe tomorrow...or not...
